# Task 2: Logistic Regression for Binary Classification

## Level 2 (Intermediate)

- **Description:** Implement a logistic regression model to predict binary outcomes (e.g., whether a customer will churn).
- **Objectives:**
    - Load and preprocess the dataset.
    - Train a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
    - Interpret model coefficients and the odds ratio.
    - Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve.
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
